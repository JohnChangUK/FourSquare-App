### An application that queries the Foursquare API for nearby venues based on a postcode and category entered by the user. This is a simple side project that shows how to integrate Redux and process data from API requests.

- Created a React project from scratch, installing necessary Node modules and configuring Webpack.
- Added Bootstrap for a more clean User Interface for the site.
- Implemented a search filter to the navigation bar, enhancing the search capability of the app.
- Users can search for food venues, coffee shops, fitness/gyms, clothing and music
